## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Game State Management
```python
# Core game state structure
{
    "match_id": str,
    "seed": int,
    "status": "active",
    "turn": int,
    "phase": "start|main|attack|end",
    "current_player": int,
    "rules": {...},
    "arena": {...},
    "players": {
        "0": {"energy": int, "mana": {}, "hero": None, "hand": [], ...},
        "1": {"energy": int, "mana": {}, "hero": None, "hand": [], ...}
    },
    "timer": {"phase_start": str, "remaining_ms": int}
}
```

### Matchmaking Flow
1. Player joins queue with ELO rating
2. Queue manager processes every 10 seconds
3. ELO-based pairing (±200 ELO difference)
4. Match created automatically when pair found
5. Players notified via WebSocket

### Real-time Communication
- **FastAPI WebSocket Service** (Port 8003)
- **Message Types**: match.*, state.*, card.*, sync.*
- **Connection Management**: Automatic reconnection
- **Game State Sync**: Real-time updates
