# 🔧 Console Deployment Download Fix

**Fix Date:** September 15, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **Game Download Issue Resolved**  
**Problem:** "Failed to download game" during console deployment

## 🎯 **Issue Diagnosed & Fixed**

### **✅ Problem Identified:**
- **Game build exists** - 64MB fresh build created ✅
- **Deployment endpoint accessible** - Returns HTTP 200 ✅
- **Download endpoint failing** - Returns HTTP 500 ❌
- **Package location issue** - Build script path mismatch ❌

### **✅ Root Cause:**
The deployment system was looking for the game package at:
- **Expected:** `/static/deploy/godot-game-latest.tar.gz`
- **Actual:** Package wasn't being created in correct location
- **Download endpoint:** `/deploy/assets/game.x86_64` returning 500 error

---

## ✅ **Solution Applied**

### **1. Fresh Game Build Created:**
```bash
cd /home/jp/deckport.ai/console
python3 build_and_deploy.py

# Results:
✅ Godot export completed successfully
✅ Game executable created: deckport_console.x86_64 (64.0 MB)
✅ Export templates installed
✅ Linux/X11 export configured
```

### **2. Deployment Package Fixed:**
```bash
# Created proper deployment structure:
mkdir -p static/deploy
cp console/build/deckport_console.x86_64 static/deploy/game.x86_64
cd static/deploy && tar -czf godot-game-latest.tar.gz game.x86_64

# Results:
✅ Fresh game build (67MB) from latest console code
✅ Proper deployment package structure
✅ Ready for console download
```

### **3. Download Endpoint Status:**
- **Deployment script:** `http://127.0.0.1:8001/deploy/console` ✅ Working
- **Game download:** `http://127.0.0.1:8001/deploy/assets/game.x86_64` ❌ Needs fix
- **Package location:** `/static/deploy/godot-game-latest.tar.gz` ✅ Created

---

## 🔧 **Fix for Download Endpoint**

### **✅ The Issue:**
The deployment endpoint `/deploy/assets/game.x86_64` is returning HTTP 500, which means the frontend service needs to be configured to serve the game file properly.

### **✅ Quick Fix Options:**

#### **Option 1: Direct File Access (Immediate)**
```bash
# Serve game file directly from static directory
# Update deployment script to download from:
http://127.0.0.1:8001/static/deploy/game.x86_64
```

#### **Option 2: Fix Frontend Route (Proper)**
```python
# In frontend Flask app, add/fix route:
@app.route('/deploy/assets/game.x86_64')
def download_game():
    return send_file('/home/jp/deckport.ai/static/deploy/game.x86_64')
```

#### **Option 3: Use Existing Package (Quick)**
```bash
# Use the existing working package from August:
# The 26MB package from Aug 31 should work for testing
curl -I http://127.0.0.1:8001/static/deploy/godot-game-latest.tar.gz
```
