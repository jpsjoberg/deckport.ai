## 🔧 **Download Issue Fix Options**

### **✅ Option 1: Fix Frontend Static Serving (Recommended)**
The frontend service needs to properly serve static files:

```python
# In frontend Flask app - add/fix route:
@app.route('/static/deploy/<path:filename>')
def serve_deploy_file(filename):
    return send_from_directory('/home/jp/deckport.ai/static/deploy', filename)

# Or configure static folder properly:
app = Flask(__name__, static_folder='/home/jp/deckport.ai/static')
```

### **✅ Option 2: Direct Game Serving (Quick Fix)**
```python
# Add specific route for game download:
@app.route('/deploy/assets/game.x86_64')
def download_game():
    return send_file('/home/jp/deckport.ai/static/deploy/game.x86_64')

@app.route('/deploy/assets/godot-game-latest.tar.gz')
def download_game_package():
    return send_file('/home/jp/deckport.ai/static/deploy/godot-game-latest.tar.gz')
```

### **✅ Option 3: Manual Console Installation (Immediate)**
```bash
# For immediate testing, manually copy game to console:
scp static/deploy/game.x86_64 user@console-ip:/opt/deckport-game/
ssh user@console-ip "chmod +x /opt/deckport-game/game.x86_64"
ssh user@console-ip "systemctl restart deckport-kiosk.service"
```

## 📞 **Next Steps**

# Test the fresh game build locally first:
cd /home/jp/deckport.ai/console/build
./deckport_console.x86_64

# Should show:
